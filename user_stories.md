# Marketing Research Team

1. As a developer, I want the marketing team to know the total number of user clicks, and also the percentage of times that an item was clicked when it was shown.
2. As a developer, I want to keep track of how many times each image is displayed and do the calculations so that the marketing team knows how to weight the value of each image.
3. As a developer, I want to visually display the resulting data so that it is easy to make marketing decisions.
4. As a developer, I want the look and feel of the web app to remind visitors of a catalog and test that a printed catalog will provide a mental escape for potential customers who are traveling.
5. As a developer, I want to provide market analysis on proposed products to test potential customer interest, so that the market research team knows what to print.

# The Developer

1. As a developer, I want to display potential products to individuals in focus groups so that the group members can choose which products they would most likely purchase.
2. As a developer, I would like to display three images at a time side-by-side, so that users are not overwhelmed by the options.
3. As a developer, I want to store, calculate, and visually display the resulting data from user decisions, so that it's clear what product group members prefer.
4. As a developer, I am interested in the number of clicks, the percentage of times an item was clicked, when it was shown, and how many times each image is displayed so that I have accurate information about users' preferences.
5. As a developer, I want to consider the marketing research team, the developer, and the focus group participant who will be using the application, so there is a good experience for everyone.

# Focus Group Participant

1. As a developer, I want to make it fun and easy for group participants to select which products they would want to purchase so that participants complete the product selection process.
2. As a developer, I want to keep the product selection process as untainted as possible by not allowing any results to be shown to users until there have been a total of 25 selections made.
3. As a developer, I want to turn off event listeners after 25 selections have been made by the participant to prevent additional voting.
4. As a developer I would like to display a list of the selected products and votes received with each list item looking like "3 votes for the Banana Slicer".
